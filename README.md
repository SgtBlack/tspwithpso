# Solve Traveling Salesman Problem with Neighborhood Using Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm



![ellipse examle](https://github.com/SgtBlack/tspwithpso/blob/master/pictures/ellipse_example.png "Example for a ellipse data-set")

Each ellipse represents the border of a town in the traveling salesman problem. In the special case with a neighborhood we do not consider the center of the town. We are interested in the question where should the traveler enter the city, if the ellipse represent the city limit.
